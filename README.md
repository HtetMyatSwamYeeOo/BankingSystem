This is a Banking System as a technical test project .

Dear Sir ,

For User Login Info of this Banking System :I created two user role 

(1) Admin (Bank Staff and Banking System Admin ) 

(2) Customer (Bank User)

Based on that two User Role,The  Permission and Authority is different.
Admin user have full access and permission like can create/edit new bank account , transfer money , deposit and withdrawal.
For the Customer User , they can deposit money , withdraw cash and can do Internal Bank Transfer with this Web Application.

Here is the Login User Name and Password Information 

Admin User USER ID : Admin

PASSWORD : admin12345

Customer UserUSER ID : NL05ABNA2807222223

PASSWORD : htetmyat

For the customer , when login, they need to use their IBAN (International Bank Account Number ) as a User ID .

Base on the technical test document of Brand New Day, I did propertly all of the steps and requirements to be done within the instructions.
And Here is the Private Git Repository Link for this Banking System Project.
